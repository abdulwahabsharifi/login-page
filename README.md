# Flutter Projects

This repository contains two simple Flutter apps that I built while learning Flutter:

## 🪙 I Am Rich App

A basic Flutter app that displays a centered diamond image with the text **"I Am Rich"**. This is a simple UI project to get started with Flutter widgets and layout.

### Features:
- Centered diamond image
- Text: *"I Am Rich"*
- Minimal and clean UI

> Inspired by the original "I Am Rich" concept app

## 🔐 Simple Login Page App

A basic login screen built using Flutter. This project focuses on creating simple UI elements like text fields and buttons.

### Features:
- Email and password input fields
- Login button (no backend logic)
- Clean layout using Flutter widgets
